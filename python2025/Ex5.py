#Example 5 Taking the value from input 

a=float(input("Enter the First value"))
b=float(input("Enter the Second value"))
total=a+b
print(total)

"""
In this example we are using input as a function/method - It's job is to take the value as input.
But it is not coverted into integer - As per python for addition , substraction , multiplication , division it should be int or float
float-100.0 , int = 100 so we need to covert into int.
