Python
pandas â€“ Data Cleaning & Analysis
numpy â€“ Numerical Computations
seaborn â€“ Data Visualization
matplotlib â€“ Graphical Representation
ðŸ“Š Key Insights & Findings
ðŸ”¹ 1. Low Salary Increases Attrition
Employees with lower salaries tend to leave for better opportunities.
Solution: Offer competitive pay to retain talent.
ðŸ”¹ 2. Long Commuting Distance Leads to Resignations
Employees with long commutes report higher dissatisfaction.
Solution: Implement remote/hybrid work options.
ðŸ”¹ 3. Excessive Overtime Causes Burnout
Employees working long hours experience fatigue & lower productivity.
Solution: Limit excessive overtime and encourage work-life balance.
ðŸ”¹ 4. Lack of Career Growth Pushes Employees Away

Solution: Provide mentorship and promotion pathways.
ðŸ”¹ 5. Poor Work-Life Balance Increases Attrition
Employees struggling with work-life balance are more likely to resign.
Solution: Offer flexible schedules and wellness programs.
ðŸ”¹ 6. New Employees Have a Higher Attrition Rate
Adjustment issues lead to early resignations.
Solution: Strengthen onboarding and engagement programs.
ðŸ”¹ 7. High-Performers Receive External Offers
Top employees often get attractive offers from competitors.
Solution: Offer retention bonuses and career development plans.
